{{Main|Remnant}}

''RWBY'' is set in the world of Remnant, a future-fantasy world with [[airship]]s, high-tech [[weapon]]ry and a form of natural energy called [[Dust]], existing side by side. According to narration in the series, the early history of Remnant has been long forgotten, with recollections being passed down in the form of myths and legends.

In the world of Remnant, all living creatures possess a soul, the physical manifestation of which is known as [[Aura]]: a form of innate energy that bestows its user with certain abilities and powers. [[Semblance]]s are unique expressions of this power, and are akin to a personal superpower unique to each character. Remnant is populated by two intelligent species - [[human]]ity and the [[Faunus]], a race of human-animal hybrids.

All of the inhabitants of Remnant are beset by the [[Grimm]], which are described as "creatures of destruction" and lack a soul. Huntsmen and Huntresses fight the Grimm and protect the peace of Remnant and its people.
