The first episode of the series premiered live to audiences at RTX 2013 (July 5–7th, 2013 in Austin, Texas), with the online public premiere taking place on July 18th, 2013.<ref name="rtp202">'''[http://rtxevent.com/home.php RTX Website] - [http://roosterteeth.com/episode/rt-podcast-season-1-rt-podcast-202 ''Rooster Teeth Podcast #202'']'''</ref> All subsequent episodes were released every Thursday at 7pm EST for the general public on the Rooster Teeth website. Rooster Teeth also uploaded each episode to YouTube one week following its premiere.

There are sixteen episodes in Volume 1. However, the episodes vary greatly in length, with episodes 1, 8 and 16 being around eleven minutes long, with all the other episodes running approximately six minutes. Volume 1 ran from July 18th to November 7th, 2013. The DVDs and Blu-rays of the first volume were released on November 12th, 2013.

===Volume 2===

It was revealed by [[Gray G. Haddock]] on January 30th, 2014 that production on ''RWBY'' Volume 2 was underway and that the first episode would premiere at RTX 2014 (July 4–6th, Austin, Texas). It was also revealed that only 12 episodes would be released in the volume rather than the 16 that were released for Volume 1, but each episode will be at least 12 minutes long due to feedback that the episodes were too short.

Episodes were not released every week, with supplemental series ''[[RWBY: World of Remnant]]'' airing in lieu of an episode on the series' off-weeks.

===Volume 3===

Monty confirmed at PAX Prime 2014 that there would be a ''RWBY'' Volume 3. The third volume also featured 12 episodes of around 16 minutes in length. The first episode of the third volume premiered on October 24th, 2015.

The third volume featured a slightly different release schedule to previous volumes, with Rooster Teeth FIRST members (formerly Sponsors) being able to watch the episode a full day earlier than the public. The weekly release time was also moved from Thursday evening to Saturday morning for FIRST members (Sunday morning for the public). As before, episodes are uploaded to YouTube one week following the public release of the episode on the Rooster Teeth website. Short 30 second previews for each episode, entitled "Coming Up Next on RWBY Vol. 3" were also uploaded on the preceding Wednesday of the week of an episode's release.

Every third episode was followed by an episode of ''RWBY: World of Remnant'', along with other week-long breaks, including the Rooster Teeth Extra Life Stream for charity on November 8th, 2015 and the ''RWBY'' Livestream on December 9th, 2015. A ''RWBY'' Volume 3 Hype Stream was also streamed on the Rooster Teeth website on February 12th, 2016, in which the cast and crew watched and commentated on the released episodes of Volume 3 in the lead-up to the finale.
