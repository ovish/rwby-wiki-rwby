''RWBY: World of Remnant'' is a supplemental mini-series, documenting various areas, beings, and objects in Remnant, the world in which ''RWBY'' is set.

''World of Remnant'' episodes air on an irregular release schedule, concurrent with the main show. ''World of Remnant'' episodes air during the main series' "off-weeks", in lieu of a full episode. These were irregularly spaced in Volume 2, but Volume 3 features a ''World of Remnant'' after every third episode of the series.
