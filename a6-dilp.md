==Development==
===Original Concept===
[[File:RWBYSil.png|thumb|250px|Red, White, Black and Yellow]]

At some point Monty Oum had a dream of four different colored girls and told Kerry about it.<ref>'''[http://manga.tokyo/interview/rwby-interview-respect-to-japanese-anime/ Manga.Tokyo Interview]'''</ref>

Monty Oum had the idea for ''RWBY'' for several years, but never got around to acting on it due to the amount of his time dedicated to his work on ''Red vs. Blue''. During the production of Season 10 of ''Red vs. Blue'', Monty decided to develop his idea further and present it to Burnie Burns. After describing the premise of the show as well as giving a description of the character that would become Ruby Rose, Monty received approval for the show.

Some of the animations and concepts Monty used in the series were in development for more than 10 years. For example, the idea for the [[Ruyi Bang and Jingu Bang|shotgun nunchucks]] used by Sun Wukong can be seen in some of Monty's very early animation work.<ref>'''[https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=677213962393479&set=vb.278065288975017&type=2&theater Monty Oum's Facebook]'''</ref> Certain characters and their fighting style, such as Qrow Branwen, also pre-date the show entirely.

Monty pitched the idea for Ruby's character to Burnie as "a badass Red Riding Hood". Fairy tales, literature, mythology and historical figures would later become a source of inspiration for other characters, who are developed with a certain existing basis in mind. However, Monty was careful to note that they are not adaptations, but rather original characters which allude to other works.<ref name="Joshua Silverman">[http://soundcloud.com/joshua-silverman-3/interview-monty-oum '''Silverman - Oum Interview''']</ref>

The theme of four colors, Red, White, Black and Yellow, each corresponding to four girls, came to Monty in a dream. This [[Color Naming Rule|color theming]] would become a core part of the character development process and a key theme in the series itself.<ref name="rtp191" />

Many characters were designed by [[Einlee|Eileen Chang]], who followed rough sketches provided by Monty and further developed them into fully-fleshed out character designs.

===Team Expansion===
[[File:Monty Miles n Kerry.jpg|thumb|250px|Series writers Monty Oum, Miles Luna and Kerry Shawcross]]

After receiving approval from Burnie, Monty then enlisted the services of [[Shane Newville]] to assist him in animating the show. The show was animated in the software [[Wikipedia:Smith Micro Software|Smith Micro's]] [[Wikipedia:Poser|Poser]], which Monty had years of experience and expertise in. The assets were modelled in [[Wikipedia:Autodesk Maya|Autodesk Maya]]. Motion capture footage was also widely used for animations in the show alongside manual animation.

[[Kerry Shawcross]] and [[Miles Luna]] were brought on by Monty to be the main writers. Monty assigned the two writers anime homework so that they could have a better idea of what Monty was aiming for.<ref name="rtp191" /> The pair developed characters based on the basic outlines given by Monty, for example, the personalities of [[Nora Valkyrie]] and [[Lie Ren]] were devised based only on the direction that they were "powerful" and "honorable", respectively. On finding the correct tone and inspiration for the series, Kerry Shawcross cited ''[[Wikipedia:Grimms' Fairy Tales|Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' as well as ''[[Wikipedia:The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air|The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' as influences.<ref>'''[https://twitter.com/kerryshawcross/status/304609298514853890 Kerry Shawcross' Twitter]'''</ref>

The four team members spent many working and off hours, in and out of the office, developing the show. One of the most frequented locations was the local [[Wikipedia:IHOP|IHOP]], where the map of Remnant, the show's setting, was developed by squirting ketchup on a napkin, with blots forming landmasses, in order to create a truly organic and emergent design. Over many such discussions, the long-term plot, world-building and characters of the series were planned out.

The first released videos for ''RWBY'' were the four trailers, which were developed mostly by Monty and Shane alone. A larger team of animators, modellers and other artists later joined the ''RWBY'' team for the production of Volume 1.

===Casting===
[[File:Lindsay_voice.jpg|thumb|250px|Lindsay voice acting for Ruby]]

After some development, Monty decided to begin casting the roles for the leads, with each lead character reflecting certain personality traits of her voice actor:

* [[Lindsay Jones]] was cast as Ruby Rose, with her silliness, but also honesty, being reflected in Ruby.
* [[Kara Eberle]] was chosen to play Weiss Schnee, as both can be nice, but at the same time "bitchy".
* [[Arryn Zech]] plays Blake Belladonna because Monty did not know much about Arryn, he had the impression that she was mysterious, just as Blake is in the series.
* [[Barbara Dunkelman]] voice acts Yang Xiao Long as both do not care what other people think about them.

Many other Rooster Teeth employees landed voice roles in ''RWBY'', with [[Jack Pattillo]] cast as [[Junior Xiong]] and [[Michael Jones]] taking on the role of Sun Wukong. Series creator Monty played Lie Ren until his death after Volume 2 aired, and writer Miles plays [[Jaune Arc]]. Other crew working on the show also had a chance to play characters, with Volume 1 Art Director [[Taylor McNee]] cast as Penny Polendina and Producer [[Gray G. Haddock]] playing Roman Torchwick.

Other actors who have previously worked with Rooster Teeth landed roles, including [[Shannon McCormick]], who had previously voiced [[w:c:rvb:Washington|Agent Washington]] in ''Red vs. Blue'', playing [[Ozpin]]; and [[Samantha Ireland]], previously the voice of [[w:c:rvb:C.T.|C.T.]] in ''Red vs. Blue'', being cast as Nora Valkyrie. [[Kathleen Zuelch]], voice of [[w:c:rvb:Tex|Agent Texas]] in ''Red vs. Blue'', voices [[Glynda Goodwitch]], and was also a Producer on Volume 1 of ''RWBY''. Voice actress [[Jen Taylor]], voice of Cortana from ''Halo'', was also contacted for Volume 1 and played the [[Salem|mysterious narrator]]. [[Jessica Nigri]], a famous cosplayer, was approached by Monty and cast as [[Cinder Fall]].

The first episode of ''RWBY'' Volume 1 premiered at RTX 2013 at the first ''RWBY'' Panel in July 2013. Development on later episodes continued during the show's run, with some episodes completed mere weeks before they were aired.

''RWBY'' Volume 1 received several accolades, including the International Academy of Web Television (IAWTV) 2014 Award for Best Animated Series<ref>'''[http://www.iawtv.org/2014-iawtv-awards-nominees-and-winners/ 2014 IAWTV Awards Nominees and Winners]'''</ref> and the 4th Streamy Awards for Best Animated Series and Best Original Score for Jeff Williams.<ref>[http://www.streamys.org/nominees-winners/4th-annual-nominees-winners/ '''4th Annual Streamys Winners & Nominees''']</ref>

Volume 3 marked a point where along with Rooster Teeth staffers and collaborators, the cast also got the addition of well-known anime voice actors, such as [[Vic Mignogna]] as [[Qrow Branwen]], [[Elizabeth Maxwell]] as [[Winter Schnee]], and [[Yuri Lowenthal]] as the new voice of [[Mercury Black]].

===Volume 2 Production===
Development on the second Volume of ''RWBY'' was documented by official production diaries, which were released during the hiatus between Volume 1 and 2. The four production diaries covered different sections of the second Volume's development.

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kPTh4ZAQ4g Production Diary 1] outlined the pre-production phase of the show, including the writing process and initial table reads.
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIX8ISA-dtg Production Diary 2] focused on artwork, and followed the design process of Velvet from original concept to final character model.
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsHo347cdHQ Production Diary 3] followed the voice acting for ''RWBY'' Volume 2. The diary also included interviews with the voice actors and covered how they get into character. For example, Lindsay takes off her shoes to get into a more childlike mindset, while Barbara basically plays herself, due to her similarity with Yang.
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tCvH6SIwQs Production Diary 4] focused on final rendering, compositing, sound design and post-production.

[[File:Prod diary 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Caiti and Monty poring over submissions for the Velvet Scarlatina battle costume contest]]

A contest was opened for the design of the character [[Velvet Scarlatina|Velvet Scarlatina's]] outfit, in order to recognize the community's contributions and include them to the show. More than 1,300 designs were submitted to the contest, with the winning one selected by Velvet's voice actress [[Caiti Ward]] and Monty Oum. A fan art contest was also opened, where some of the submitted fan art was featured in the ending credits of episodes of Volume 2.

During development of the second Volume, the show adopted more subtle, balanced lighting in contrast to the brighter and flatter lighting of the first Volume, and the character models underwent an overhaul. The black silhouette background characters that were present in the first Volume were replaced with fully-rendered procedurally generated models in the second, in order to add more vibrance to the world. [[Kristina Nguyen]], who worked on environmental designs during Volume 1, was the Art Director for Volume 2, and worked closely with the modellers on the environment models and textures.

Returning voice actors included the voice cast of Volume 1, including cosplayer Jessica Nigri, who had a widely expanded role as primary antagonist Cinder, for whom she also performed the motion capture.

Notable additions to the voice cast for Volume 2 included [[J.J. Castillo]] as [[Mercury Black]], [[Katie Newville]] (animator Shane Newville's wife) as [[Emerald Sustrai]] and [[Ashley Jenkins]] as [[Coco Adel]]. Series writer and co-director [[Kerry Shawcross]] was cast as [[Neptune Vasilias]]. [[Jason Rose]], a Los Angeles-based filmmaker who had always wanted to work with Monty on a project, also joined the cast as [[James Ironwood]].

Volume 2 again premiered at RTX 2014, which took place from July 4th–6th, 2014.

===Volume 3 Production===

[[File:RWBY Vol3 Crew 2.jpg|thumb|250px|A gathering of members of the ''RWBY'' Volume 3 crew]]

In the lead-up to Volume 3, new crew members were brought on board. [[Dillon Gu]], an animator known for creating ''Project MONTY'', a series of fan animations in tribute to Monty, was hired by Rooster Teeth. New production artist [[Erin Winn]] designed many of the characters that appeared in Volume 3, including [[ABRN|Team ABRN]] and [[BRNZ|Team BRNZ]]. Some fans of the show also received the chance to design their own original characters, [[NDGO|Team NDGO]], for backing the Indiegogo campaign for Rooster Teeth's new feature film ''Lazer Team''.

As the series gained popularity, it garnered the attention of famous professional voice actor [[Vic Mignogna]], who approached Rooster Teeth to play a role on the show. Vic would be cast as [[Qrow Branwen]] in Volume 3. Other famous professional voice actors involved with the show starting with Volume 3 include [[Elizabeth Maxwell]], voice of [[Winter Schnee]], and [[Yuri Lowenthal]], the new voice of [[Mercury Black]]. Rapper [[Flynt Flossy]] of [[Wikipedia:Turquoise Jeep Records|Turquoise Jeep Records]] also voiced the character [[Flynt Coal]]. [[Laura Bailey]] and [[Travis Willingham]] also had cameo roles as minor characters. Notably, Jen Taylor reprised her role from the first Volume.

Rooster Teeth would continue to draw from internal talent to voice characters, with [[Meg Turney]], an established Rooster Teeth personality and host of ''The Know'' playing [[Neon Katt]], and animator [[Yssa Badiola]] as [[Ciel Soleil]], amongst others. Also joining the cast is Monty's brother [[Neath Oum]], who took over the role of Lie Ren. Some voice actors also provided motion capture performances for other characters, with Barbara performing [[Winter Schnee|Winter Schnee's]] motion capture and Miles doing mocap for Qrow Branwen.

The first episode of Volume 3 premiered on October 24th, 2015. As with previous seasons, production continued during the original run, with animation wrapping on January 22nd, 2016.<ref name="v3rap">'''[https://twitter.com/graymartigan/status/690935798225448960 Gray Haddock's Twitter]'''</ref> February 12th, 2016 was the last day of production on ''RWBY'' Volume 3.<ref name="abtv_v3e10">'''[https://youtu.be/kW9ONvrvgt4?t=965 AfterBuzz TV]'''</ref>

The third volume of ''RWBY'', especially the sixth episode, entitled "[[Fall]]", has been widely noted as being a turning point in the series, adopting a darker tone and more mature subject matter. In response, producer Gray G. Haddock released a statement that viewer discretion was advised for future installments of the series, especially for younger audiences. Gray compared ''RWBY'' to ''Harry Potter'', ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' and ''Star Wars'' as being a multi-year spanning series that would mature as it continues.<ref>'''[http://roosterteeth.com/post/51193367 Gray Haddock's Rooster Teeth Journal]'''</ref>

In January 2016, midway through the original run of Volume 3, lead animator and long-time member of the ''RWBY'' crew, Shane Newville, left Rooster Teeth.<ref>'''[http://twitter.com/shanenewville/status/685491662030684161 Shane Newville's Twitter]'''</ref>

''RWBY'' Volume 4 and ''RWBY Chibi'' were animated in [[Wikipedia:Autodesk Maya|Autodesk Maya]], unlike previous volumes of ''RWBY'', which were animated in [[Wikipedia:Smith Micro Software|Smith Micro's]] [[Wikipedia:Poser|Poser]]. Kerry Shawcross cites scalability as one of the advantages of the switch, expanding the number of people capable of working on the team. The new software also made real-time lighting, shadows and other effects feasible.<ref name="rtx2016sat">'''RTX 2016 ''RWBY'' Panel (Saturday)'''</ref>

In addition to the improvements in animation, the visual style of the show was also overhauled, with all character models remade and many of the Grimm redesigned by Erin Winn and remodeled. Concept artist Eileen Chang, who worked on the original concepts for the 4 main characters, was also brought back to create their new timeskip outfits and designs.<ref name="rtx2016sat" />

===Volume 5===
The Volume 5 online premiere date, October 14th, 2017 was announced at RTX Austin 2017. In addition, theatrical screenings of the premiere were held through Fathom Events across the United States on October 12th.

Also teased at RTX Austin was a first look at the "[[Volume 5 Weiss Character Short]]", which premiered on July 17th, 2017. Character shorts for Blake and Yang premiered on September 4th and October 14th, respectively. Each short gives a flashback while also connecting it to the main timeline.

Volume 5 continued to use Autodesk Maya software, but some visual elements were added. Most notably, a third lighting layer is sometimes in use on characters.<ref name="CRWBY: Behind the Episode">'''CRWBY: Behind the Episode'''</ref>
