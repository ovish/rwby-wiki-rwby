Episodes of the series are watchable in their entirety on Rooster Teeth's website and YouTube. The series is also simulcast concurrent with the public release of the show on anime streaming website Crunchyroll. Previous seasons were available on the internet streaming service Netflix.[3]

In 2016, theatrical screenings of RWBY Volume 1 in Australia, the United Kingdom and United States were announced, with the help of screening and events coordinator Tugg. The theatrical screenings took place from April 27th, 2016.[4] Screenings for Volumes 2 and 3 were also announced for 2016 in the lead-up to Volume 4.[5] Screenings for Volume 2 took place on July 27th.[6]

## Volume 1
The first episode of the series premiered live to audiences at RTX 2013 (July 5–7th, 2013 in Austin, Texas), with the online public premiere taking place on July 18th, 2013.[7] All subsequent episodes were released every Thursday at 7pm EST for the general public on the Rooster Teeth website. Rooster Teeth also uploaded each episode to YouTube one week following its premiere.

There are sixteen episodes in Volume 1. However, the episodes vary greatly in length, with episodes 1, 8 and 16 being around eleven minutes long, with all the other episodes running approximately six minutes. Volume 1 ran from July 18th to November 7th, 2013. The DVDs and Blu-rays of the first volume were released on November 12th, 2013.

## Volume 2
It was revealed by Gray G. Haddock on January 30th, 2014 that production on RWBY Volume 2 was underway and that the first episode would premiere at RTX 2014 (July 4–6th, Austin, Texas). It was also revealed that only 12 episodes would be released in the volume rather than the 16 that were released for Volume 1, but each episode will be at least 12 minutes long due to feedback that the episodes were too short.

Episodes were not released every week, with supplemental series RWBY: World of Remnant airing in lieu of an episode on the series' off-weeks.

## Volume 3
Monty confirmed at PAX Prime 2014 that there would be a RWBY Volume 3. The third volume also featured 12 episodes of around 16 minutes in length. The first episode of the third volume premiered on October 24th, 2015.

The third volume featured a slightly different release schedule to previous volumes, with Rooster Teeth FIRST members (formerly Sponsors) being able to watch the episode a full day earlier than the public. The weekly release time was also moved from Thursday evening to Saturday morning for FIRST members (Sunday morning for the public). As before, episodes are uploaded to YouTube one week following the public release of the episode on the Rooster Teeth website. Short 30 second previews for each episode, entitled "Coming Up Next on RWBY Vol. 3" were also uploaded on the preceding Wednesday of the week of an episode's release.

Every third episode was followed by an episode of RWBY: World of Remnant, along with other week-long breaks, including the Rooster Teeth Extra Life Stream for charity on November 8th, 2015 and the RWBY Livestream on December 9th, 2015. A RWBY Volume 3 Hype Stream was also streamed on the Rooster Teeth website on February 12th, 2016, in which the cast and crew watched and commentated on the released episodes of Volume 3 in the lead-up to the finale.

The DVD/Blu-Ray release of RWBY Volume 3 were released on May 3rd, 2016.[8]

## Volume 4
Volume 4 premiered on October 22nd, 2016.[9] It followed a similar release schedule to Volume 3, being released on Saturday for Rooster Teeth FIRST members followed by the release for registered users of the Rooster Teeth site on Sunday, 24 hours later. It was then released to the public and uploaded to YouTube the week following the FIRST members' release.

The Volume 4 premiere was preceded by the "Volume 4 Character Short" on October 3rd, 2016.[10] The character short features an original story and animation and does not cut from upcoming scenes, making it the first non-ediitorial trailer since the four character trailers for Volume 1.

On the week of October 17th, Rooster Teeth began airing RWBY: World of Remnant episodes, narrated by Qrow Branwen, that go into detail about each of the kingdoms.

The RWBY Volume 4 Finale was first released at RTX Sydney, several hours before it was released for FIRST-members.[11]

## Volume 5
Volume 5 premiered on October 14th, 2017. There were three new character shorts leading up to Volume 5.[12]

On June 20th, 2017, it was announced an exclusive sneak peek of Volume 5 would premiere at Anime Expo 2017, including an exclusive screening of the Japanese dub of Volume 3.[13]

On July 17th, 2017, the "Volume 5 Weiss Character Short" was released to the public, with a work-in-progress version shown at the RTX 2017 RWBY Panel on July 7th, 2017, exclusively for attendees. Just like the Volume 4 Character Short, it features an original story and animation.

On September 26th, 2017, it was announced that the first chapter of Volume 5 would premiere in selected theaters on October 12th, 2017 before the official release on October 14th.[14]

On October 14th, the "Volume 5 Yang Character Short" was released to the public together with the first episode of Volume 5, with a work-in-progress version shown at the NYCC 2017 RWBY Screening on October 6th, 2017, exclusively for attendees.
